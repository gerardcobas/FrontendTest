# JuniorFrontendTest

Hello I'm Pedro, this is my implementation of the challenge. As requested I only used pure Javascript and CSS, typically I work woth frameworks over these technologies such as SASS, React or Angular.

Sorry for the delay, the challenge took me nearly 12 hours todo, as I need to study the Github API, and I only coded like 1/2 hours per night after the work. 

Regarding the implementation, to run it you just need to do the following steps

1. npm install to install some dependencies of the proeject 
2. npm run start to run create a local server to the page
3. npm test - (optional) to run the some unit tests that I created.

If you have any doubts please feel free to let me know or make a code review with me.

Best regards,

Pedro Mira Lopes
