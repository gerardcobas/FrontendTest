# JuniorFrontendTest

## GOALS


#### The main goal of this tech test is to create a client side web application that reproduces the screenshots below by using [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) .

We will only evaluate the client side code and the criteria will be based mainly on:

1. Good use of **pure Javascript** language without external libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React...
2. Clean HTML and CSS markup
3. Clean, maintainable & easy­to­read
4. Good architectural practices

## HOW TO START

1. Investigate the github api calls for user and repos (for example: test them in the browser)
2. Fork this repository & cd into the directory
3. Launch the web application, for example with: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337
4. Open the browser with http://localhost:1337/ and start coding!

## NOT REQUIRED, BUT IMPRESSIVE

- Adding Unit Testing. External libraries limitation doesn't apply here, you can use Jasmine, Karma...
